<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello there! I'm Tyler, and I'm on a journey to bridge the gap between my pricing background and my love for creative design. While I may be considered entry-level in the exciting world of UI/UX, I bring with me a unique set of transferable skills and a deep-seated passion for art and design that has been with me since childhood.</p>

<h2>Numbers to Creativity</h2>

<p> career path has predominantly been in pricing, where I've honed my skills in process management, leading teams, and bringing different departments together for a common goal. But beneath the surface, there's always been an artist in me. As a child, I dreamt of being an artist, and that passion never truly left me. It's what fuels my ability to visualize designs and concepts, helping me see the creative potential in every project.</p>

<h2>Gravitation Towards Research and Management</h2>

<p>Throughout my journey, I've gravitated towards research, product management, and project management. While I may not always be the one to fully execute the designs, I play a crucial role in bringing them to life. Staying organized, telling a clear story to stakeholders, keeping my team on track, and focusing on the task at hand are my strengths. I excel in asking the right questions to ensure we gather rich and valuable data.</p>

<h2>A Collaborator at Heart</h2>

<p>What truly excites me about the field of UI/UX is the opportunity to work in a collaborative environment. I thrive on collaborating with diverse teams to explore the best possible ways and processes to bring designs to life. The synergy that comes from combining different perspectives is where innovation truly shines.

<h2>Adapting to Change and Problem Solving</h2>

My experience has taught me to be adaptable and responsive to change, a crucial trait in the ever-evolving landscape of UI/UX. I approach challenges as opportunities to problem-solve and find creative solutions. It's this mindset that drives me to continuously learn and grow in this field.

<h2>In My Free Time</h2>

In my spare time, I enjoy sketching with gel pens, immersing myself in the serenity of nature, and exploring new horizons, whether it's through music, art, food, or culture. I firmly believe that great design has the power to transform user experiences, and I'm excited to contribute my unique blend of skills, creativity, and the expertise to ask the right questions for rich data to the UI/UX community.
